KSP-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules

=========================



Stand alone fixes for common stock KSP bugs. These modules are meant to be fully stock compatible. My aim is to be able to remove them from the game at any time without causing a problem for the stock saves.





Bug fixes included so far

=========================



+ ChuteQuickloadFixer.dll - Fixes "Tiny Chutes" or disappearing chutes on quickload


+ AnchoredDecouplerFix.dll - Fixes radial decouplers not wanting to decouple correctly at high speed (leading to boosters striking the core stack)





Installation

============



Just download the desired fix's .dll and place in the KSP/GameData directory. No other downloads, file changes, or add-ons are required.

Alternately, you can download the whole repository and place it in the KSP/GameData directory.
